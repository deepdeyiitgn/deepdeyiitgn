## About Me 🚀

Hello! I’m **Deep Dey**, currently a Class 11 CBSE student from Tripura, with my eyes set on cracking **JEE 2027** and earning a seat at **IIT Kanpur (CSE branch)**.  
My journey is defined by ambition, relentless discipline, and a modern approach to learning and building — by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence.

### 🎯 My Mission & Ambitious Goals

- **2026:** Achieve mastery in all Class 11 topics and cover the entire JEE syllabus for Class 11.
- **2027:** Score **240+ in JEE Mains** and **330+ in JEE Advanced**, to secure an **All India Rank (AIR) under 70** and gain admission to **IIT Kanpur (CSE Branch)**.

I am building a path to the IIT dream not only through hard work and consistency, but also by **embracing new technology and rethinking how students can use AI as an academic and creative accelerator**.

## My Philosophy 💡

**I am not a traditional coder.**  
I do not write complex code by hand or have mastery over coding languages in the way expert programmers do. Instead, I **leverage the power of AI and prompt engineering** to generate efficient, high-quality code for my projects, websites, and apps. My real skill is knowing how to design, prompt, and shape AI-generated solutions to bring my ideas to life.  
- I am proof that **discipline and smart use of technology can fill the gaps** where traditional skills are still developing.
- I believe that in the modern world, being an “AI-native” creator is as valuable as being a manual coder.
